# STM32-Tutorial-Projects

This repository contains two branches dedicated to STM32 tutorial projects:

## Branches Overview:

- **Main branch**:  
  Includes tutorial projects I developed using the **STM32F407VGTx** microcontroller, showcasing three different programming approaches:  
  - **Standard Peripheral Library (StdPeriph library)**
  - **Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL library)**
  - **Register-based programming techniques** 

- **STM32F103C8T6 branch**:  
  Features tutorial projects I developed for the **STM32F103C8T6** microcontroller using the HAL Library.
